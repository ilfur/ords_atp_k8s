Oracle Java in Containers
=====
This repository contains sample container configurations to facilitate installation and environment setup for DevOps users. This project includes Dockerfiles based on Oracle Linux with JDK images of JDK 16, 11, and for Server JRE 8.

Oracle Java Server JRE provides the features from Oracle Java JDK commonly required for server-side applications (i.e. Running a Java EE application server). For more information about Server JRE, visit the [Understanding the Server JRE blog entry](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/understanding-the-server-jre) from the Java Product Management team.

## Building the Oracle Java base image
Download the linux x-64 compressed archive (tar.gz) [JDK or Server JRE](https://www.oracle.com/javadownload) for the version you want to create an image of and place it in the same directory as the corresponding Dockerfile.

e.g. for JDK 16 download jdk-16[X]_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz into OracleJava/16, 
for ServerJRE 8 download server-jre-8uXXX-linux-x64.tar.gz into OracleJava/8

Navigate to the folder containing the download and run `docker build`. Tag it with the correct version number.

e.g. For JDK 16 run
```
$ cd ../OracleJava/16
$ docker build --tag oracle/jdk:16 .
```

for Server JRE 8 run
```
$ cd ../OracleJava/8
$ docker build --tag oracle/serverjre:8 .
```

The right command with the correct tag is already scripted in `build.sh` so you can alternatively run:
```
$ bash build.sh
```
### Parent image OS version

The Oracle Java image for JDK 16 uses `oraclelinux:8-slim` as the parent image.

The build script `build.sh` will tag the JDK 16 image as `16` and also as `16-oraclelinux8`.

JDK 11 and ServerJRE 8 use `oraclelinux:7-slim` as the default parent image but allow for optionally building on `oraclelinux:8-slim` by using `Dockerfile.8-slim` rather than `Dockerfile`.

e.g. to build JDK 11 with Oracle Linux 8 rather than the default Oracle Linux 7 run

```
$ cd ../OracleJava/11
$ docker build --file Dockerfile.8-slim --tag oracle/jdk:11-oraclelinux8 .
```
On releases prior to JDK 16 `build.sh` can be used to build on Oracle Linux 7 or on Oracle Linux 8, by passing `8-slim`.

e.g. 

```
$ cd ../OracleJava/11
$ bash build.sh 8-slim
```
